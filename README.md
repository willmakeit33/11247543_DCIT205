Project Reflection

Throughout the development of the Computer Science Department Website, I have gained insights into:

Structuring and presenting information effectively for a departmental website.

The significance of clear navigation tailored to diverse user groups (students, faculty, prospective students).

Strategies for maintaining a cohesive and visually appealing design.

Application of responsive design principles for a positive user experience across devices.

This project has offered valuable experiences in web development for institutional purposes. I hope this website proves to be a useful and informative platform for our department's community.
